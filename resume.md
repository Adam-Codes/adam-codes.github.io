#### **Bold Commerce**
During my time with Bold Commerce, I was able to gain experience and contribute throughout Bold’s tech stack, from front-end to back-end; including excellent test coverage. Among the technical work, I was also able to work with and contribute to the Bold Brain team dynamic and had the privilege of leading the team through a documentation workshop to help create a shared team documentation “manifesto”.

* Assisted in front-end architecture refactor through creation of a design pattern to allow greater extensibility and maintainability.
* Developed a front-end feature to trigger remote events (React, Golang, Php, Rabbitmq).
* Automated a manual, reoccurring team task through the use of a Slack bot (Node.js).
* Wrote extensive end-2-end & unit testing to increase the reliability and stability of production code.

Resolute TS is a consulting company that assists businesses to achieve their technological needs, from IT outsourcing, staffing, and general IT services to software development solutions.
Using Agile methodologies; developed a full-stack project using SpringBoot, REST services and creation of and communication with various Docker microservices. This project was designed to accept client information as JSON data and to prepare the information to automate Office 365 and NT login creation. 

Responsible for the architecture design, communication with stakeholders and coding the solution.
Requirements for the application included SOLID principles to allow for the ability to:

* Scale breadth (add additional clients).
* Scale depth (automate additional tasks).
* Modify and configure existing implementation with minimal development needed (through the use of configuration files).

### Operations Manager  			      			   2011 – 2017
#### **Shaw Communications**
Accountable for all operations and meeting/exceeding key metrics for large contact center operations. Facilitated process improvements, change management and efficiency in operations while building an engaged and inspired workforce.
