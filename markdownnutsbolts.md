# How to format a resume using MarkDown
## Markdown?
### What is markdown?
Markdown is a lightweight markup language, similar to HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language). 

What makes markup language great is it allows us to seperate presentation from content, as well as being easy to read.

There are many different "dialects" of markdown, often expanding on functionality or shifting syntax slightly. Github uses their dialect "Github Flavored Markdown".

If you are unfamiliar with markdown, this is a great time to make yourself familiar. There many excellent resources out there; I am fond of Github's guide for [Mastering markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
#### The basic building blocks of markdown are:
There are different flavors and more complexities to markdown that you can pursue if you are interested, but for the purposes of this README this should be sufficient to understand the basics of creating a resume in markdown
> `#`  - Header   (`#` followed by space)
>
> `**` - **Bold** (`**Bold**`)
>
> `*`  - Bullets  (`*` followed by space)
>
> `_`  - _Italic_ (`_Italic_`)

## Nuts and bolts
Organize your resume with headers that are consistent and make sense
provide additional link to markdown
provide the basics

Headers H1-H6 which are used via the `#` the H number corresponds to the number of hashtags to use in descending order.
Example:
``` 
# This is the largest header h1
## this is the second largest header h2
.
.
.
###### This is the smallest header h6
```
># This is the largest header h1
>## this is the second largest header h2
>### .
>#### .
>##### .
>###### This is the smallest header h6

Use the building blocks to continue to organize the desired components of your resume

## PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE

### `<your position with company>, Co-op work term 2 <duration of employment example: Jan 2020 - Apr 2020`>
#### `<insert company here>`
<company specific write up>During my time with Bold Commerce, I was able to gain experience and contribute throughout Bold’s tech stack, from front-end to back-end; including excellent test coverage. Among the technical work, I was also able to work with and contribute to the Bold Brain team dynamic and had the privilege of leading the team through a documentation workshop to help create a shared team documentation “manifesto”.
* Assisted in front-end architecture refactor through creation of a design pattern to allow greater extensibility and maintainability.
* Developed a front-end feature to trigger remote events (React, Golang, Php, Rabbitmq).
* Automated a manual, reoccurring team task through the use of a Slack bot (Node.js).
* Wrote extensive end-2-end & unit testing to increase the reliability and stability of production code.
